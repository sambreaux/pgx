CYP2D6,*1/*10,"CYP2D6 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one reduced functionallele, this individual is predicted to have a normal metaboliser phenotype. For adrug extensively metabolised by CYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects maybe expected to lie within the normal range."
CYP2C19,*1/*1,"CYP2C19 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range."
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range."
VKORC1,AA,"VKORC1 - Significantly reduced VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in significantly reduced amountsand the response to warfarin will be enhanced. The CYP2C9 genotype should alsobe considered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initialwarfarin dose."
CYP1A2,*1F/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Ultrarapid metaboliser (with inducer present)Due to the presence of two *1F alleles, this individual is predicted to have anultrarapid metaboliser phenotype. Enzyme activity is highest in the presence ofinducers, such as tobacco smoke, regular consumption of cruciferous vegetablesor chargrilled meats, and certain drugs. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP1A2, drug exposure and clinical effects may either be reduced (for an activedrug) or increased (for a prodrug)."
CYP3A4,*1/*1,"CYP3A4 - Normal metaboliserThe *22 allele is not present and this individual is expected to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Whilst many drugs are known to be metabolised byCYP3A4, relatively few genetic variations have been found that affect metabolismof a limited number of these drugs."
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians."

SLCO1B1,TC,"SLCO1B1 - Decreased Transporter functionThis individual carries one copy of the decreased function *5 allele and ispredicted to have decreased function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter.Decreased clearance of certain medications such as simvastatin is expected."
OPRM1,AG,"OPRM1 - Intermediate opioid sensitivityThe AG genotype contains one normal allele (A) and one variant allele (G) for theOPRM1 gene which encodes the mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence aroundOPRM1 genetic variation continues to develop, it appears that the G allele isassociated with a reduced response to certain opioids (in particular, morphine).These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies and at least twometa-analyses15,16 however, this is not shown in all studies. For naltrexone in themanagement of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shown an association ofthe G allele with superior clinical outcomes. Note the frequency of the variantallele (G) is higher in people of Asian ancestry (around 40%) than Europeanancestry (around 15%)."
