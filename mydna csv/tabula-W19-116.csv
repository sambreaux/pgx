EXPLANATION OF GENETIC RESULTS,,
GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION
CYP2D6,*1/*2,"CYP2D6 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range."
CYP2C19,*17/*17,"CYP2C19 - Ultrarapid metaboliserDue to the presence of two increased function alleles, this individual is predictedto have an ultrarapid metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolisedby CYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects may either be decreased (for anactive drug) or increased (for a prodrug). The individual is at risk of therapeuticfailure (active drug) or adverse effects (prodrug)."
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range."
VKORC1,GG,"VKORC1 - Normal VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in normal amounts and theresponse to warfarin will be normal. The CYP2C9 genotype should also beconsidered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initial warfarindose."
CYP1A2,*1A/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of only one copy of the *1F allele, this individual is predictedto have a normal metaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2substrate drugs is predicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to beincreased by exposure to inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietarycomponents and drugs."
CYP3A4,*1/*1,"CYP3A4 - Normal metaboliserThe *22 allele is not present and this individual is expected to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Whilst many drugs are known to be metabolised byCYP3A4, relatively few genetic variations have been found that affect metabolismof a limited number of these drugs."
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians."
SLCO1B1,TC,"SLCO1B1 - Decreased Transporter functionThis individual carries one copy of the decreased function *5 allele and ispredicted to have decreased function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter.Decreased clearance of certain medications such as simvastatin is expected."
OPRM1,AA,"OPRM1 - Higher opioid sensitivityThe AA genotype contains two normal alleles for the OPRM1 gene which encodesthe mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence around OPRM1 genetic variationcontinues to develop, it appears that this result is associated with increasedsensitivity to certain opioids (in particular, morphine) compared to those with thevariant allele (G). These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies andat least two meta-analyses16,17 however, this is not shown in all studies. Fornaltrexone in the management of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shownan association of this result with a reduced response compared to those with thevariant allele. Note the frequency of the variant allele (G) is higher in people ofAsian ancestry (around 40%) than European ancestry (around 15%)."
