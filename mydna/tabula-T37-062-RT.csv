GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*1/*1X2,"CYP2D6 - Ultrarapid metaboliserDue to the presence of three copies of a normal function allele, this individual ispredicted to have an ultrarapid metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensivelymetabolised by CYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects may either bedecreased (for an active drug) or increased (for a prodrug). This individual is at riskof therapeutic failure (active drug) or adverse effects (prodrug).",T37-062-RT
CYP2C19,*1/*17,"CYP2C19 - Rapid metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one increased functionallele, this individual is predicted to have a rapid metaboliser phenotype. For adrug extensively metabolised by CYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects mayeither be slightly decreased (for an active drug) or slightly increased (for aprodrug). This individual is at risk of therapeutic failure (active drug) or adverseeffects (prodrug).",T37-062-RT
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",T37-062-RT
VKORC1,GG,"VKORC1 - Normal VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in normal amounts and theresponse to warfarin will be normal. The CYP2C9 genotype should also beconsidered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initial warfarindose.",T37-062-RT
CYP1A2,*1F/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Ultrarapid metaboliser (with inducer present)Due to the presence of two *1F alleles, this individual is predicted to have anultrarapid metaboliser phenotype. Enzyme activity is highest in the presence ofinducers, such as tobacco smoke, regular consumption of cruciferous vegetablesor chargrilled meats, and certain drugs. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP1A2, drug exposure and clinical effects may either be reduced (for an activedrug) or increased (for a prodrug).",T37-062-RT
CYP3A4,*1/*22,"CYP3A4 - Intermediate metaboliserThis individual carries one copy of the reduced function *22 allele and is predictedto have an intermediate metaboliser phenotype. Reduced metabolism of certainCYP3A4 substrate drugs (e.g. quetiapine) is expected. This may result in increaseddrug exposure and clinical effects.",T37-062-RT
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",T37-062-RT
SLCO1B1,TC,"SLCO1B1 - Decreased Transporter functionThis individual carries one copy of the decreased function *5 allele and ispredicted to have decreased function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter.Decreased clearance of certain medications such as simvastatin is expected.",T37-062-RT
OPRM1,AA,"OPRM1 - Higher opioid sensitivityThe AA genotype contains two normal alleles for the OPRM1 gene which encodesthe mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence around OPRM1 genetic variationcontinues to develop, it appears that this result is associated with increasedsensitivity to certain opioids (in particular, morphine) compared to those with thevariant allele (G). These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies andat least two meta-analyses14,15 however, this is not shown in all studies. Fornaltrexone in the management of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shownan association of this result with a reduced response compared to those with thevariant allele. Note the frequency of the variant allele (G) is higher in people ofAsian ancestry (around 40%) than European ancestry (around 15%).",T37-062-RT
