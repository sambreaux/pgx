GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*4/*4,"CYP2D6 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two null alleles, this individual is predicted to have a poormetaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised by CYP2D6, drugexposure and clinical effects may either be greatly increased (for an active drug) orgreatly decreased (for a prodrug). The individual is at risk of experiencing adverseeffects (active drug) or therapeutic failure (prodrug).",T31-061
CYP2C19,*1/*1,"CYP2C19 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",T31-061
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",T31-061
VKORC1,AG,"VKORC1 - Moderately reduced VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in moderately reduced amountsand the response to warfarin will be enhanced. The CYP2C9 genotype should alsobe considered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initialwarfarin dose.",T31-061
CYP1A2,*1A/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of only one copy of the *1F allele, this individual is predictedto have a normal metaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2substrate drugs is predicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to beincreased by exposure to inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietarycomponents and drugs.",T31-061
CYP3A4,*1/*22,"CYP3A4 - Intermediate metaboliserThis individual carries one copy of the reduced function *22 allele and is predictedto have an intermediate metaboliser phenotype. Reduced metabolism of certainCYP3A4 substrate drugs (e.g. quetiapine) is expected. This may result in increaseddrug exposure and clinical effects.",T31-061
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",T31-061
SLCO1B1,TT,"SLCO1B1 - Normal Transporter FunctionThe decreased function *5 allele is not present and this individual is predicted tohave normal function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter. The transporter isimportant for the clearance of certain drugs, including simvastatin.",T31-061
OPRM1,AA,"OPRM1 - Higher opioid sensitivityThe AA genotype contains two normal alleles for the OPRM1 gene which encodesthe mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence around OPRM1 genetic variationcontinues to develop, it appears that this result is associated with increasedsensitivity to certain opioids (in particular, morphine) compared to those with thevariant allele (G). These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies andat least two meta-analyses24,25 however, this is not shown in all studies. Fornaltrexone in the management of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shownan association of this result with a reduced response compared to those with thevariant allele. Note the frequency of the variant allele (G) is higher in people ofAsian ancestry (around 40%) than European ancestry (around 15%).",T31-061
