GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*2/*41,"CYP2D6 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one reduced functionallele, this individual is predicted to have a normal metaboliser phenotype. For adrug extensively metabolised by CYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects maybe expected to lie within the normal range.",S94-283
CYP2C19,*2/*2,"CYP2C19 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised by CYP2C19,drug exposure and clinical effects may either be greatly increased (for an activedrug) or greatly decreased (for a prodrug). This individual is at risk of experiencingadverse effects (active drug) or therapeutic failure (prodrug).",S94-283
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",S94-283
VKORC1,AG,"VKORC1 - Moderately reduced VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in moderately reduced amountsand the response to warfarin will be enhanced. The CYP2C9 genotype should alsobe considered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initialwarfarin dose.",S94-283
CYP1A2,*1F/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Ultrarapid metaboliser (with inducer present)Due to the presence of two *1F alleles, this individual is predicted to have anultrarapid metaboliser phenotype. Enzyme activity is highest in the presence ofinducers, such as tobacco smoke, regular consumption of cruciferous vegetablesor chargrilled meats, and certain drugs. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP1A2, drug exposure and clinical effects may either be reduced (for an activedrug) or increased (for a prodrug).",S94-283
CYP3A4,*1/*1,"CYP3A4 - Normal metaboliserThe *22 allele is not present and this individual is expected to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Whilst many drugs are known to be metabolised byCYP3A4, relatively few genetic variations have been found that affect metabolismof a limited number of these drugs.",S94-283
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",S94-283
SLCO1B1,TT,"SLCO1B1 - Normal Transporter FunctionThe decreased function *5 allele is not present and this individual is predicted tohave normal function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter. The transporter isimportant for the clearance of certain drugs, including simvastatin.",S94-283
OPRM1,AG,"OPRM1 - Intermediate opioid sensitivityThe AG genotype contains one normal allele (A) and one variant allele (G) for theOPRM1 gene which encodes the mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence aroundOPRM1 genetic variation continues to develop, it appears that the G allele isassociated with a reduced response to certain opioids (in particular, morphine).These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies and at least twometa-analyses19,20 however, this is not shown in all studies. For naltrexone in themanagement of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shown an association ofthe G allele with superior clinical outcomes. Note the frequency of the variantallele (G) is higher in people of Asian ancestry (around 40%) than Europeanancestry (around 15%).",S94-283
