GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*2/*10,"CYP2D6 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one reduced functionallele, this individual is predicted to have a normal metaboliser phenotype. For adrug extensively metabolised by CYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects maybe expected to lie within the normal range.",L65-346
CYP2C19,*2/*2,"CYP2C19 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised by CYP2C19,drug exposure and clinical effects may either be greatly increased (for an activedrug) or greatly decreased (for a prodrug). This individual is at risk of experiencingadverse effects (active drug) or therapeutic failure (prodrug).",L65-346
VKORC1,AG,"VKORC1 - Moderately reduced VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in moderately reduced amountsand the response to warfarin will be enhanced. The CYP2C9 genotype should alsobe considered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initialwarfarin dose.",L65-346
CYP1A2,*1A/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of only one copy of the *1F allele, this individual is predictedto have a normal metaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2substrate drugs is predicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to beincreased by exposure to inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietarycomponents and drugs.",L65-346
CYP3A4,*1/*1,"CYP3A4 - Normal metaboliserThe *22 allele is not present and this individual is expected to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Whilst many drugs are known to be metabolised byCYP3A4, relatively few genetic variations have been found that affect metabolismof a limited number of these drugs.",L65-346
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",L65-346
SLCO1B1,CC,"SLCO1B1 - Poor Transporter FunctionDue to the presence of two decreased function alleles, this individual is predictedto have poor function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter. Decreased clearanceof certain medications such as simvastatin is expected.",L65-346
OPRM1,AA,"OPRM1 - Higher opioid sensitivityThe AA genotype contains two normal alleles for the OPRM1 gene which encodesthe mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence around OPRM1 genetic variationcontinues to develop, it appears that this result is associated with increasedsensitivity to certain opioids (in particular, morphine) compared to those with thevariant allele (G). These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies andat least two meta-analyses19,20 however, this is not shown in all studies. Fornaltrexone in the management of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shownan association of this result with a reduced response compared to those with thevariant allele. Note the frequency of the variant allele (G) is higher in people ofAsian ancestry (around 40%) than European ancestry (around 15%).",L65-346
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliser Due to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted to have a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised by CYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within the normal range.",L65-346
