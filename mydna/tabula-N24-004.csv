GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*1/*1,"CYP2D6 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",N24-004
CYP2C19,*1/*17,"CYP2C19 - Rapid metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one increased functionallele, this individual is predicted to have a rapid metaboliser phenotype. For adrug extensively metabolised by CYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects mayeither be slightly decreased (for an active drug) or slightly increased (for aprodrug). This individual is at risk of therapeutic failure (active drug) or adverseeffects (prodrug).",N24-004
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",N24-004
VKORC1,AA,"VKORC1 - Significantly reduced VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in significantly reduced amountsand the response to warfarin will be enhanced. The CYP2C9 genotype should alsobe considered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initialwarfarin dose.",N24-004
CYP1A2,*1A/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of only one copy of the *1F allele, this individual is predictedto have a normal metaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2substrate drugs is predicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to beincreased by exposure to inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietarycomponents and drugs.",N24-004
CYP3A4,*1/*1,"CYP3A4 - Normal metaboliserThe *22 allele is not present and this individual is expected to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Whilst many drugs are known to be metabolised byCYP3A4, relatively few genetic variations have been found that affect metabolismof a limited number of these drugs.",N24-004
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",N24-004
SLCO1B1,TC,"SLCO1B1 - Decreased Transporter functionThis individual carries one copy of the decreased function *5 allele and ispredicted to have decreased function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter.Decreased clearance of certain medications such as simvastatin is expected.",N24-004
OPRM1,AA,"OPRM1 - Higher opioid sensitivityThe AA genotype contains two normal alleles for the OPRM1 gene which encodesthe mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence around OPRM1 genetic variationcontinues to develop, it appears that this result is associated with increasedsensitivity to certain opioids (in particular, morphine) compared to those with thevariant allele (G). These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies andat least two meta-analyses15,16 however, this is not shown in all studies. Fornaltrexone in the management of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shownan association of this result with a reduced response compared to those with thevariant allele. Note the frequency of the variant allele (G) is higher in people ofAsian ancestry (around 40%) than European ancestry (around 15%).",N24-004
