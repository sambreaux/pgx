GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*1/*2,"CYP2D6 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",N43-034
CYP2C19,*1/*2,"CYP2C19 - Intermediate metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one no function allele, thisindividual is predicted to have an intermediate metaboliser phenotype. For a drugextensively metabolised by CYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects mayeither be increased (for an active drug) or decreased (for a prodrug). Thisindividual is at risk of experiencing adverse effects (active drug) or therapeuticfailure (prodrug).",N43-034
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",N43-034
VKORC1,GG,"VKORC1 - Normal VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in normal amounts and theresponse to warfarin will be normal. The CYP2C9 genotype should also beconsidered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initial warfarindose.",N43-034
CYP1A2,*1A/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of only one copy of the *1F allele, this individual is predictedto have a normal metaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2substrate drugs is predicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to beincreased by exposure to inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietarycomponents and drugs.",N43-034
CYP3A4,*1/*1,"CYP3A4 - Normal metaboliserThe *22 allele is not present and this individual is expected to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Whilst many drugs are known to be metabolised byCYP3A4, relatively few genetic variations have been found that affect metabolismof a limited number of these drugs.",N43-034
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",N43-034
SLCO1B1,TC,"SLCO1B1 - Decreased Transporter functionThis individual carries one copy of the decreased function *5 allele and ispredicted to have decreased function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter.Decreased clearance of certain medications such as simvastatin is expected.",N43-034
OPRM1,AG,"OPRM1 - Intermediate opioid sensitivityThe AG genotype contains one normal allele (A) and one variant allele (G) for theOPRM1 gene which encodes the mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence aroundOPRM1 genetic variation continues to develop, it appears that the G allele isassociated with a reduced response to certain opioids (in particular, morphine).These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies and at least twometa-analyses16,17 however, this is not shown in all studies. For naltrexone in themanagement of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shown an association ofthe G allele with superior clinical outcomes. Note the frequency of the variantallele (G) is higher in people of Asian ancestry (around 40%) than Europeanancestry (around 15%).",N43-034
