GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*1/*1,"CYP2D6 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",X73-150
CYP2C19,*1/*2,"CYP2C19 - Intermediate metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one no function allele, thisindividual is predicted to have an intermediate metaboliser phenotype. For a drugextensively metabolised by CYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects mayeither be increased (for an active drug) or decreased (for a prodrug). Thisindividual is at risk of experiencing adverse effects (active drug) or therapeuticfailure (prodrug).",X73-150
CYP2C9,*1/*2,"CYP2C9 - High intermediate metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one decreased functionallele, this individual is predicted to have a high intermediate metaboliserphenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised by CYP2C9, drug exposure andclinical effects may either be increased (for an active drug) or decreased (for aprodrug). As the *2 allele is associated with only a small reduction in enzymefunction, this variation may only be significant for certain medications, with highdosages or if drug-drug interactions occur.",X73-150
VKORC1,AA,"VKORC1 - Significantly reduced VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in significantly reduced amountsand the response to warfarin will be enhanced. The CYP2C9 genotype should alsobe considered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initialwarfarin dose.",X73-150
CYP1A2,*1A/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of only one copy of the *1F allele, this individual is predictedto have a normal metaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2substrate drugs is predicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to beincreased by exposure to inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietarycomponents and drugs.",X73-150
CYP3A4,*1/*22,"CYP3A4 - Intermediate metaboliserThis individual carries one copy of the reduced function *22 allele and is predictedto have an intermediate metaboliser phenotype. Reduced metabolism of certainCYP3A4 substrate drugs (e.g. quetiapine) is expected. This may result in increaseddrug exposure and clinical effects.",X73-150
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",X73-150
SLCO1B1,TT,"SLCO1B1 - Normal Transporter FunctionThe decreased function *5 allele is not present and this individual is predicted tohave normal function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter. The transporter isimportant for the clearance of certain drugs, including simvastatin.",X73-150
OPRM1,AG,"OPRM1 - Intermediate opioid sensitivityThe AG genotype contains one normal allele (A) and one variant allele (G) for theOPRM1 gene which encodes the mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence aroundOPRM1 genetic variation continues to develop, it appears that the G allele isassociated with a reduced response to certain opioids (in particular, morphine).These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies and at least twometa-analyses17,18 however, this is not shown in all studies. For naltrexone in themanagement of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shown an association ofthe G allele with superior clinical outcomes. Note the frequency of the variantallele (G) is higher in people of Asian ancestry (around 40%) than Europeanancestry (around 15%).",X73-150
