GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*4/*4,"CYP2D6 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two null alleles, this individual is predicted to have a poormetaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised by CYP2D6, drugexposure and clinical effects may either be greatly increased (for an active drug) orgreatly decreased (for a prodrug). The individual is at risk of experiencing adverseeffects (active drug) or therapeutic failure (prodrug).",L65-296
CYP2C19,*1/*1,"CYP2C19 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",L65-296
CYP2C9,*1/*2,"CYP2C9 - High intermediate metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one decreased functionallele, this individual is predicted to have a high intermediate metaboliserphenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised by CYP2C9, drug exposure andclinical effects may either be increased (for an active drug) or decreased (for aprodrug). As the *2 allele is associated with only a small reduction in enzymefunction, this variation may only be significant for certain medications, with highdosages or if drug-drug interactions occur.",L65-296
VKORC1,AG,"VKORC1 - Moderately reduced VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in moderately reduced amountsand the response to warfarin will be enhanced. The CYP2C9 genotype should alsobe considered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initialwarfarin dose.",L65-296
CYP1A2,*1A/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of only one copy of the *1F allele, this individual is predictedto have a normal metaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2substrate drugs is predicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to beincreased by exposure to inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietarycomponents and drugs.",L65-296
CYP3A4,*1/*1,"CYP3A4 - Normal metaboliserThe *22 allele is not present and this individual is expected to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Whilst many drugs are known to be metabolised byCYP3A4, relatively few genetic variations have been found that affect metabolismof a limited number of these drugs.",L65-296
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",L65-296
SLCO1B1,TT,"SLCO1B1 - Normal Transporter FunctionThe decreased function *5 allele is not present and this individual is predicted tohave normal function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter. The transporter isimportant for the clearance of certain drugs, including simvastatin.",L65-296
OPRM1,GG,"OPRM1 - Lower opioid sensitivityThe GG genotype contains two variant alleles for the OPRM1 gene which encodesthe mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence around OPRM1 genetic variationcontinues to develop, it appears that the G allele is associated with a reducedresponse to certain opioids (in particular, morphine). These findings are supportedby a number of cohort studies and at least two meta-analyses24,25 however, this isnot shown in all studies. For naltrexone in the management of alcohol usedisorder, some studies have shown an association of the G allele with superiorclinical outcomes. Note the frequency of the variant allele (G) is higher in peopleof Asian ancestry (around 40%) than European ancestry (around 15%).",L65-296
