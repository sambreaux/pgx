GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*1/*36,"CYP2D6 - Low normal metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one null allele, thisindividual is predicted to have a low normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drugextensively metabolised by CYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects may eitherbe moderately above (for an active drug) or moderately below (for a prodrug) thenormal range. This genotype predicts a modest change in drug exposure which isunlikely to be clinically significant except for certain narrow therapeutic-indexdrugs, with high dosages or if drug-drug interactions occur.",N24-329-RT
CYP2C19,*1/*2,"CYP2C19 - Intermediate metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one no function allele, thisindividual is predicted to have an intermediate metaboliser phenotype. For a drugextensively metabolised by CYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects mayeither be increased (for an active drug) or decreased (for a prodrug). Thisindividual is at risk of experiencing adverse effects (active drug) or therapeuticfailure (prodrug).",N24-329-RT
CYP2C9,*1/*1,"CYP2C9 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C9, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",N24-329-RT
VKORC1,AA,"VKORC1 - Significantly reduced VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in significantly reduced amountsand the response to warfarin will be enhanced. The CYP2C9 genotype should alsobe considered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initialwarfarin dose.",N24-329-RT
CYP1A2,*1A/*1F,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of only one copy of the *1F allele, this individual is predictedto have a normal metaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2substrate drugs is predicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to beincreased by exposure to inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietarycomponents and drugs.",N24-329-RT
CYP3A4,*1/*1,"CYP3A4 - Normal metaboliserThe *22 allele is not present and this individual is expected to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Whilst many drugs are known to be metabolised byCYP3A4, relatively few genetic variations have been found that affect metabolismof a limited number of these drugs.",N24-329-RT
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",N24-329-RT
SLCO1B1,TT,"SLCO1B1 - Normal Transporter FunctionThe decreased function *5 allele is not present and this individual is predicted tohave normal function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter. The transporter isimportant for the clearance of certain drugs, including simvastatin.",N24-329-RT
OPRM1,AA,"OPRM1 - Higher opioid sensitivityThe AA genotype contains two normal alleles for the OPRM1 gene which encodesthe mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence around OPRM1 genetic variationcontinues to develop, it appears that this result is associated with increasedsensitivity to certain opioids (in particular, morphine) compared to those with thevariant allele (G). These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies andat least two meta-analyses17,18 however, this is not shown in all studies. Fornaltrexone in the management of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shownan association of this result with a reduced response compared to those with thevariant allele. Note the frequency of the variant allele (G) is higher in people ofAsian ancestry (around 40%) than European ancestry (around 15%).",N24-329-RT
