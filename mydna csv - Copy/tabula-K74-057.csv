GENE,GENOTYPE,PREDICTED FUNCTION,ID
CYP2D6,*1/*2,"CYP2D6 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2D6, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",K74-057
CYP2C19,*1/*1,"CYP2C19 - Normal metaboliserDue to the presence of two normal function alleles, this individual is predicted tohave a normal metaboliser phenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised byCYP2C19, drug exposure and clinical effects may be expected to lie within thenormal range.",K74-057
CYP2C9,*1/*2,"CYP2C9 - High intermediate metaboliserDue to the presence of one normal function allele and one decreased functionallele, this individual is predicted to have a high intermediate metaboliserphenotype. For a drug extensively metabolised by CYP2C9, drug exposure andclinical effects may either be increased (for an active drug) or decreased (for aprodrug). As the *2 allele is associated with only a small reduction in enzymefunction, this variation may only be significant for certain medications, with highdosages or if drug-drug interactions occur.",K74-057
VKORC1,GG,"VKORC1 - Normal VKORC1 enzyme levelThe VKORC1 enzyme is predicted to be present in normal amounts and theresponse to warfarin will be normal. The CYP2C9 genotype should also beconsidered together with the VKORC1 genotype for calculating the initial warfarindose.",K74-057
CYP1A2,*1A/*1A,"CYP1A2 - Normal metaboliserThe *1F allele is not present and this individual is predicted to have a normalmetaboliser phenotype. Normal metabolism of CYP1A2 substrate drugs ispredicted. Furthermore, metabolism is not expected to be increased by exposureto inducers such as tobacco smoking and certain dietary components and drugs.",K74-057
CYP3A4,*1/*22,"CYP3A4 - Intermediate metaboliserThis individual carries one copy of the reduced function *22 allele and is predictedto have an intermediate metaboliser phenotype. Reduced metabolism of certainCYP3A4 substrate drugs (e.g. quetiapine) is expected. This may result in increaseddrug exposure and clinical effects.",K74-057
CYP3A5,*3/*3,"CYP3A5 - Poor metaboliserDue to the presence of two no function alleles, this individual is predicted to havea poor metaboliser phenotype (CYP3A5 non-expresser). CYP3A5 is known tometabolise certain drugs, including tacrolimus. Note that this individual'sgenotype is the most common one amongst Caucasians.",K74-057
SLCO1B1,TC,"SLCO1B1 - Decreased Transporter functionThis individual carries one copy of the decreased function *5 allele and ispredicted to have decreased function of the SLCO1B1 encoded transporter.Decreased clearance of certain medications such as simvastatin is expected.",K74-057
OPRM1,AA,"OPRM1 - Higher opioid sensitivityThe AA genotype contains two normal alleles for the OPRM1 gene which encodesthe mu opioid receptor. Whilst the evidence around OPRM1 genetic variationcontinues to develop, it appears that this result is associated with increasedsensitivity to certain opioids (in particular, morphine) compared to those with thevariant allele (G). These findings are supported by a number of cohort studies andat least two meta-analyses15,16 however, this is not shown in all studies. Fornaltrexone in the management of alcohol use disorder, some studies have shownan association of this result with a reduced response compared to those with thevariant allele. Note the frequency of the variant allele (G) is higher in people ofAsian ancestry (around 40%) than European ancestry (around 15%).",K74-057
